# Florist Simulation
This is a C++ implementation of a florist simulation, based on the florist example given in Lecture #1. The simulation involves various persons, such as Chris, Fred, Wholesaler, Grower, Gardener, Robin, Delivery Person, and Flower Arranger. These persons interact with each other by exchanging messages (i.e., invoking methods) to complete the flower ordering process.
